# Alzheimer_Prediction_Abeta38

## Overview
This repository contains code and report for the analysis of the cerebral-spinal cord (CSF) protein 38 and its potential role in distinguishing healthy individuals from those with Alzheimer's disease. The study investigates the hypothesis that Abeta38, a protein associated with Abeta peptides, may have a discernible impact on differentiating between healthy and sick individuals.

## Background
Alzheimer's disease is characterized by the presence of amyloid-beta plaques in the brain, typically ranging from 36 to 43 peptides in length. While extensive research has focused on longer isoforms of amyloid-beta, emerging evidence suggests that shorter isoforms, including Abeta38, may also play a role in the disease.

## Objective
The primary goal of this analysis is to assess whether CSF protein 38 has a statistically significant effect on distinguishing between healthy and sick individuals. To achieve this, various statistical tests will be applied to the data to quantify the potential association between CSF38 levels and health status.

## Data
Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.usc.edu). The ADNI was launched in 2003 as a public-private partnership, led by Principal Investigator Michael W. Weiner, MD. The primary goal of ADNI has been to test whether serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early Alzheimer’s disease (AD).
